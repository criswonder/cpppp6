Do Programming Exercise 4 from Chapter 9 but convert the Sales structure and
its associated functions to a class and its methods. Replace the setSales(Sales &,
double [], int) function with a constructor. Implement the interactive
setSales(Sales &) method by using the constructor. Keep the class within the
namespace SALES.

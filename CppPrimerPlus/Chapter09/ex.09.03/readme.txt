Begin with the following structure declaration:

struct chaff
{
    char dross[20];
    int slag;
};

Write a program that uses placement new to place an array of two such structures in
a buffer.Then assign values to the structure members (remembering to use
strcpy() for the char array) and use a loop to display the contents. Option 1 is to
use a static array, like that in Listing 9.10, for the buffer. Option 2 is to use regular
new to allocate the buffer.
